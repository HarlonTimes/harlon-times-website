Johnson Park has had many new features built by the sports mogul Boris who owns Boris Inc. These features include more seating, team emblem, dome roof, stairs to different seating levels, home and away locker rooms, gym, and a press room. Johnson Park will also have parking for Harlonians who want to go see the hockey game but have to drive. Johnson Park has lived up to its one billion dollar price tag. But the reason for the stadium is the name of the Hockey team that will call Johnson Park its home stadium. Harlon Huskies will play in Johnson Park as their home stadium! Harlon Huskies have gotten lots of interest from top players nationally and and contract talks are still on going. Johnson Park will create thousands of jobs after the construction which in turn will help boost the economy. Boris said in a statement he is "extremely satisfied" with the progress of Johnson Park and believes it will hold games within the next 6 months. Johnson Park is part of an ongoing construction all over the south side of Harlon, the lower west side has seen a library and government buildings being built. Meanwhile on the lower east side Johnson Park and residential buildings have been constructed. That is our second update on Johnson Park and all the exciting additions since we last did an update, See you at Johnson Park when it opens!
