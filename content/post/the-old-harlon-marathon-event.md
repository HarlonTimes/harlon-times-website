As most of us know by now, yesterday the Old Harlon Marathon Event  
took place. This was amazing! Everyone who participated managed to  
get a good look at Old Harlon while also taking part in the last ever event  
on Old Harlon.

  
The Scores were:  
1st Place - Peter_Crafter  
2nd Place - SwiftGolem059  
3rd Place - BarkingFaun123

This was a very fun event to attend. Thank you Harlon Staff for hosting  
such an amazing event for people to enjoy! Although there were some  
people without food, the staff supplied them with some food and even  
supplied some bottles of water!

  
Here are some in game screenshots of the event:
