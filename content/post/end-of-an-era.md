Today, August 29th marks an end of an era for Harlon and the staff who have worked hard to maintain and build this incredible server!  Today led by KarWe players were treated to a final goodbye tour of old Harlon and seeing things most players have never seen before!  It was an emotional tour especially for the players who have played since the beginning. Some players find it hard to leave behind so many memories and hard work but there is hope with New Harlon being a huge success and only growing.  the memories will not fade because we will always remember Old Harlon and how it brought us together to meet new people and enjoy the great community on this server!  All the Harlon players would like to say huge thanks to the staff for being so dedicated to Harlon and always putting in the work to make this the best Minecraft server there is!  We wont forget Old Harlon but now it is time for New Harlon!
