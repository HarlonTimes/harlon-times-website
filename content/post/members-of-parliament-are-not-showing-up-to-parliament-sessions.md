Parliament Session on Saturday September 25 was canceled due to only one 

MP showing up. Parliament was set to vote on three amendments including 

Amendment for Government Functionary, Extension of Parliamentry Vote 

Deadline, Fare Fine Reduction, and Harlon Sporting Event Amendments. 

Most MP's send in their votes to the Speaker before the Parliament Session 

but there is a need for MP's to show up to the parliament session. The 

Parliament session was set to start at 18:00 UTC which historically has been 

a time that works for most MP's. Pro of Survival was the only MP that 

showed up to the Parliament session, he is the leader of the Harlon Green 

Party which proposed three amendments for today's session. In October 

there will be an election where Harlonian's will be able to vote for new MP's 

and inactivity should be brought up for the next election. If MP's are inactive 

there was an amendment passed called the Inactive MP Amendment where 

there is three strikes and if you don't send your votes or don't go show up to

Parliament you will be removed as an MP. Inactivity Amendment is not liked 

by all MP's so much so there was talks of an amendment that would repeal 

the inactivity amendment. If Members of Parliament are not active there will 

be no amendments being passed which in turn will keep Harlonian's without 

a functioning government and that is not what the Harlon People voted for 

and sent their Parties members to Parliament to do. When you are elected 

to congress you have a duty to the people who got you there. They voted 

on your promises and it is your job to deliver on those promises and that 

starts by showing up. Next Month is the October Election and no better 

time to vote out inactive MP's and replace with MP's who will get stuff done.
