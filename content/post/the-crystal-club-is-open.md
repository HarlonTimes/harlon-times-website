Crystal Club which is west of Southbank Circus is an adult club and only opened at nights and will close its doors during the day. If you stay in the club during the day there will be no way out. In the club there is a bar with a special drink and on the other end there is a dance floor to rock the night away after a long week of work. This is a huge addition to Harlon as Harlonians have a place to relax and chill out. We believe this will create a huge economic benefit too because money will go straight to the government account and then to all Harlonians. So next time you are tired and want to relax and take a load off head down to the Crystal Club!
