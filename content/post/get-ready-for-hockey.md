With the success of the donation campaign, hockey in Harlon is right around the corner! The only current team is the Harlon Huskies but there are rumors several teams planning to form and see if they can beat the Harlon Huskies! Sports mogul Boris of Boris inc said in a statement today about the success of the donation campaign "I am pleased to say that we have surpassed the goal of donating $130 towards a hockey plugin! Me and the entire staff team are so grateful for this communities help towards this I will contact the land developer ASAP! Thanks again and again this means the world to us!" Harlonians are in for a treat with a soccer stadium and now the already famous Johnson Park which will make its debut soon! Johnson Park continues to make the final touches with floors getting a face lift with shop space as well as social spaces to congregate with your friends in between game periods or before or after the action. The biggest donator to get make hockey a possibility was Optimized followed by Harlon Time's very own Nexalin then GoldenPortal next it was a tie of Antlucl, mltkr, and KarWe, then Pro of Survival, and lastly Nich2007olas19 & SwiftGolem059. We send a huge thank you to all the donators who enable all Harlonains to have an awesome experience!
