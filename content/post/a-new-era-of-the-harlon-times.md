Beginning in the new year, the Harlon Times will be under the ownership of HBC! This is a major development in Harlon's news and broadcasting industry, and we believe it'll greatly improve news quality and accessibility. 

The Harlon Broadcasting Corporation is a company based around providing consumers with live coverage of sporting events, expansive television resources, and soon, accurate up-to-date news. If you want to stop by Studio 01, HBC's primary location, you can find it to the left once you exit the Oxville commuter station. Feel free to visit and say hello!

The Harlon Times will also be saying goodbye to its location in the Whaler's Way tower at Berry Isle and will be temporarily relocating to Stage B at HBC Studio 01. We aim to refresh the look of the Harlon Times with a brand-new set.

Furthermore, the Harlon Times Discord server will be closing its doors and will be transferred over to the [HBC Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eAurqUyGyd). You can join that to see when new articles are posted and apply to become a writer, however, all legacy Harlon Times staff will keep their existing jobs.

Despite a large number of changes, we hope you'll continue reading our articles to stay informed about what's happening in Harlon.
