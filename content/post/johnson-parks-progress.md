Johnson Park is a new attraction that has been making serious progress recently. Johnson Park is located on the lower east side north of the factories and includes a stadium and several shops and homes surrounding it. Boris the sports mogul and Founder & CEO of Boris Inc is funding the massive 1 Billion pound project. Up to this point there have been only 5 injuries and they were immediately rushed to the hospital where they were discharged within a few days. This project is huge for not only Harlon but the surrounding communities because during construction there have been two thousand jobs created. However when the project is finished it is projected that will only keep one thousand jobs cutting the employees in half. Johnson Stadium has made serious progress with the grand stands and the ice rink already built. It is projected the stadium will be finished by the end of November. Thank you for reading and we will see you again in the next article.
