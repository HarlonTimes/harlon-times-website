        A “final” goodbye As you must have seen, Old Harlon has returned for 2 days, 2 days of excitement for everyone, to the idea of discovering, or re-discovering this not-so-forgotten place. Old Harlon is a place of memories for veterans, and a way to meet up with past for the most recent players of us all. The world will surely be missed; however, we can suppose that access to it will be preserved for special events such as, this year, the server’s two-year anniversary. During that special event, – which we could call a “blast to the past”, referring to Harlon’s 1-year-anniversary. 

       Hello Harlonians, it is Nexalin, and I am going to break down my experiences on Old Harlon. Old Harlon is sadly closing today and will be deleted during Christmas. I joined Harlon on the first of September in 2019 and I was greeted by Kovacs who said “Welcome” which is what we now do to all players who Join. I joined Harlon because I saw they had a working metro system, and I was eager to ride a metro where the minecarts are together like a real train! Pretty soon after I had gotten into business with my first company which was called Capital Records which the name implies, I sold records. When I was younger, I would have to use the family computer and would join when I could. Not too long later I applied for builder and surprisingly was accepted and from then on, I helped build some of the buildings that are in Old Harlon and New Harlon. Fast forward too today and I am a new helper on Harlon and officially part of the staff team and I couldn't be happier to represent such a wonderful server!
