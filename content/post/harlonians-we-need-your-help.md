**Harlonian Staff need your help!**

         As you may have noticed we have been building a new arena called **Johnson Park**. Johnson Park is a hockey arena and one of our most ambitious projects in Harlon. It would be a shame if we can't use it! In order for us to use Johnson Park we need a hockey plugin. Since we need make a completely new and original plugin and none of us can code at that high level we need to hire a developer. The plugin will then cost $130 (US) for us to make that's where we need your help. We are asking kindly for donations in order for us to get this hockey plugin and play hockey as well as start a hockey league. Me myself will donate $46 towards the plugin and then $86 is left. Can we as a community donate this money? If we don't reach our goal of $86 all donations will be refunded. The plugin will have: - Hockey like physics - The ability to start Brawls - Customizable team colors and team names - announcements for bystanders as well as GUI - Shooting - Passing - Tackles And hopefully much more. Thanks in advance - Harlon Staff Team.

        Johnson Park is almost finished and its time to make the finishing touches! During Construction today floor 1 has been completed with a few shops and tables to eat before going to watch the Harlon Huskies defeat their opponents! Under the stadium construction of the player parking has also been completed with fifty plus parking spots. Once the stadium is finished and a league started, Hockey will be able to be played with the plugin which is gathering donations. Boris of Boris Inc said in a statement today that Johnson Stadium "one of our most ambitious projects in Harlon" and so far that ambition had paid off. Johnson Park is projected to be finished by the end of next week and we cannot wait to see what it looks like when it is completed. Thank you for reading and hope to catch you next time in the next Harlon Times article! Go Huskies!
