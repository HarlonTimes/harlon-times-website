Sad end of an era for Harlon and all who knew Kovacs and how much he contributed to Harlon not only in Parliament but with helping people and being a fun person to be with. As Speaker Kovacs oversaw a lot of Parliament and was the driving force that helped Parliament keep going and kept everything in order along with other staff members who were involved. Kovacs announcing he has decided to retire came as a shock to everyone who has come to know the consistency of Parliament and Kovacs help on all issues. Kovacs was also a senior moderator who helped keep Harlon City Server a welcoming community with staff members who are always there to help and people everyone could rely on. Kovacs rose up through ranks from being a resident to a builder, to helper, and lastly senior moderator. He has proved what it takes to become a staff member for Harlon and to move up in the ranks. Kovacs said today "Hello! I'm Kovacs. I joined more than one year ago. However, today I would like to announce I'm going to resign and leave the server. The reasons are very simple: I'd like to focus on school and study as much as I just can. Of course there are other smaller reasons, but that is confidential and I'd like not to tell them here. I'm really sad, I really enjoyed to be a part of this community and I really liked to be a staff. I would like to thank this for everyone! P.S.: I decided this more than 2-3 weeks ago and I have already told this to Antlucl one week ago. I just wanted to hold the last session in this term." We wish Kovacs luck in his studies and thank him for all he has done for the Harlon Community! We will miss you a lot!
