Mysterious Snowhenge like formations found on the biggest mountain in New Harlon! These type of discoveries only raise questions, as an example, are these structures hiding something? Are these structures connected to the Harlon government and if so what are they hiding on top of a mountain and covered by snow? Is this Harlon's version of the stone henge? These formations were found by Nexalin, I was hiking the biggest and coldest mountain in New Harlon when out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a structure. When I turned I saw snow stacked together coming out of the ground. I walked around the supposed structures but could not find anything that resembles an entrance. Once I saw the first snow blocks coming out of the ground I noticed a castle like structure (thumbnail) and I thought for sure these are buildings or secret bases covered in snow. The weirdest part is all three are in a large circle and it looks like I might have missed one to complete the circle. This is not the end as we will continue to investigate to find the truth behind the mysterious Snowhenges.
