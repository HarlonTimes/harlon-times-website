Hi Harlonians it is Juzzy I am here to write about my experience on Harlon the way I found out about Harlon is that I was looking for city servers to play on I tried and I didn’t find a good one and then I found out about Harlon and I started to enjoy it I made some new friends like Nexalin. I found some things to do such as mining, starting businesses and ways to earn money in game and in new Harlon I was able to buy my first race car in game. There is a lot to do on Harlon and I really like it and I will keep playing until I had enough but that won’t be any time soon here are somethings you can do on Harlon for guests who are new to Harlon you can go to the Hibbings Ore mine and mine for rare ores instead of needing to buy them u can sell logs at Roslagen tree plantation and u can ride the Harlon’s broad transportation network u can buy a factory and you can make a shop so make sure to do this fun stuff on Harlon.
