The truth about he GO2Card is that it is not a scam but rather there is nothing wrong with it.  Antlucl, the Owner of the server tried to reproduce it. However he didn't find any problem nor bug. It is understandable that players are annoyed to have to pay an extra 75 pounds every time they just want to use the metro. But calling it a scam is not correct and should not be used to label this issue.  But if you do not like paying an extra 75 pounds there is bus service and you can walk to your destination or remember to clock out when using the metro or bus services.
