This world famous tavern is turning 200 years old Today! Jordan's Tavern which has been running in the family for 200 years has grown to be world famous and attracting people all over the world! The reason it is world famous because of its signature special water! The ingredients for this water have been a close guarded secret its whole existence. Jordan the current owner says he cannot divulge the secret in the water but he said he could give us a taste. The water indeed tastes fantastic and us at The Harlon Times would highly recommend it! When we asked Jordan how he feels about the 200th birthday of his family's pub, he said, "I think its a great milestone and this will only be a stepping block to what to expect in the next 200 years! We might even add locations!" Jordan is clearly loving the family business and we and Harlon are too!
