Old Harlon has been opened again temporarily! On the 2 Year Anniversary of Harlon, Old Harlon has been opened too the public for its final 48 hours. Everyone is excited and people are saying the nostalgia is real. Old Harlon was reopened at 6:30 to all Harlonians for 2 days, and everyone was very excited. There was a 20-30 minute fun-ride from Belton Street on the Millennium Line all the way to Stenford Bay, then an unplanned Emmaru Service driven by JustSkepp_YT back to city centre, then everyone disbanded once arriving to Stockholm Street.
