August 29th is the last day Old Harlon will be open! That world has been open for over 1 and a half years, and so many memories have been made on it. Before we close it however, staff will be hosting a Marathon event in the old world to give everyone a last full look at the city! The marathon event will be held at 6:00am UTC Time and there are prizes!

1st Place - 1500 Pounds

2nd Place - 800 Pounds

3rd Place - 400 Pounds

100 Pounds to everyone to participated but did not place.

We hope to see everyone there!
