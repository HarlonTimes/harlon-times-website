Harlon's fourth general election looming within 10 days here are the important facts about it and what you need to know. The time for the 4th general election has come! Polls open on Friday October 29th 18:00 UTC and close 48 hours later Sunday October 31st 18:00 UTC. The Party Registry is now open! The party registration for the October 2021 Election is now open and will remain so until Sunday October 24th next week at 20:00 UTC. The place to cast your ballot and make your voice heard will be at spawn to the right of where you spawn. To get to spawn if you do not immediately spawn their do /spawn.  So far there are several parties that have announced they are running including Harlonian Green Party, Democratic Alliance Party, Living City Party, Harlonian Business Party, and Sunrise National Party. Recent polling has showed Harlonian Business Party in the lead, but it is not indicative of how well the election will go because of the small sample size of the polls. Voter turnout is a major part of the general election, and we encourage all Harlonians to make their voice heard and to vote for the party that represents your issues. "I am on the fence about voting and don't believe it will actually make a difference". Being able to vote and take part in the election is a major part of the Harlon Democracy where your voice is heard, and your vote will have a major impact on the outcome of the election. To talk about being able to vote and about whether swing voters intend on voting we sat down with Harlon Staff Member Howbe! Our first question to Helper Howbe was, do you plan on voting in the election or do not plan on voting and why? Howbe replied with "My current position is that I'm not, however that could change. It's for reasons I don't really want to publicly reveal at the moment." Our second question was, since you do not plan on voting yet is there a party that may change your mind to get to you vote? Howbe answered with "Maybe. I have 2 in mind." Our last question to Howbe in the short interview was, what is a policy you would want to see enacted after this election? Howbe dubiously answered with "I think a policy I am strongly behind is the ones to clean up Stenford. I as a rail owner find it extremely hard to find station space, and most of it is covered by abandoned claims." From this interview Harlon Times gathered information from a swing voter including that if a party has a clear and unambiguous message that they may be able to have swing voters latch onto their movement to get that party elected and eventually the policy the voter wants enacted. With the election right around the corner make a plan to vote, which day and what time of the day do I want to vote and what works for me. We can't wait to see you October 29th at the ballot box!
