Since the last election in April, the Harlon Wok Party (HWP) and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Harlon Party (DAB) have formed a coalition government. DAB leader thegoldenportal was confirmed as Prime Minister along with HWP leader Dirt0066 as Deputy Prime Minister. After forming a coalition on May 1st, they have been leading the government for two months. 

According to the HWP's manifesto, they promised the following changes: 

1\. Give a voice to all Harlonians 

2\. Get rid of price dumping/gauging 

3\. Keep taxes as low as possible while keeping a fair economy system 

4\. Propose foods plugin 

5\. "Mining" inflation 

Out of these 5 promises, the HWP has delivered somewhat on only 2 of them. Given the coalition has made no changes to the tax rate since election, it can be argued that the HWP has kept taxes low. Additionally, given the #bill-suggestions channel, we can say they have given a voice to Harlonians. However as for promises #2, #4, and #5, we have not seen any proposals on it. 

According to DAB's manifesto, they promised the following changes: 1. Lower transport fares 2. Introducing the /back home command temporarily 3. Better economy and creating more jobs 4. Property justice 5. Mayor elections for Harlon City by October 2022 

Out of these 5 promises, the DAB has delivered on 1 and somewhat only 2 of them. The House of Assembly passed Bill-22-04-01 which temporarily enabled the /home command, proposed by a DAB MP. As for the other 2 promises, they were only somewhat fulfilled. 

For creating more jobs, DAB has created 1 position with a total of 3 jobs through the National Celebration Committee bill. For property justice, DAB voted to repeal the Harlon Property Code Act, however has not delivered on anything else for that topic. 

Currently the only bills proposed by the coalition include: 

\- Repeal of the Property Code by ItsAdamLY (Bill-22-05-04) 

\- Government-Owned Crops Store Policy 2022 by thegoldenportal (Bill-22-05-05) 

\- ROD Wixley Beach by KompixGaming (Bill-22-06-01) 

\- Forming the National Celebration Committee by thegoldenportal (Bill-22-06-02) 

In a matter of two months, the coalition has proposed a total of 4 bills, and delivered only somewhat on half of their promises (5/10). The question is, in these next four months, can we expect action to be taken?
